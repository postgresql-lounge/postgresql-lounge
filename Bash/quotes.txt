[15:21] <Zr40> dexen: why not POST?
[15:22] <dexen> working on a web app; wanted to be able to click on link and have it open in new tab
[15:22] <Zr40> <form ... target=_blank>
[15:23] <dexen> ...
[15:23] <dexen> 10 years a web developer
[15:23] <dexen> never realized i can do that
[15:23] * dexen headdesks
[15:26] <Zr40> how to headdesk dexen in just 24 bytes

[14:27] <kus> does bleach evaporate?

[18:04] <sobel> woo, i won a little prize for highest-severity bug found in a team-wide bugbash
[18:19] <dexen> a serious bug /is/ a world-open patch/upgrade mechanics ;)
[18:51] <xiaomiao> "community-administrated servers" you say?
[18:52] <sobel> >:)

[21:36] <sobel> i really should have a lot of sham business cards
[21:36] <sobel> Especially one introducing me as Bobby; DROP TABLE STUDENTS;
[21:37] <sobel> related: i'm pretty sure my code is the only code here that bothers to sanitize user inputs when constructing sql.

[15:14] <dev1> is it still possible to find employment in IT without smoking /something/?
[15:15] <dev2> I quit crack years ago and I'm happily employed

[15:26] <bonsaikitten> YesSQL is best NoSQL replace ;)

[07:06] <sobel> it's a short cut so i don't have to count characters when things appear a bit off
[07:06] <Myon> maybe you just need a hotkey to switch to a monospace font temporarily for that part
[07:06] <sobel> i'd rather see my code as i prefer it all the time
[07:07] <sobel> i'm not seeing benefits to kerning my code windows
[07:08] <Zr40> for me, I just don't see a need to have characters be monospaced all the time
[07:08] <sobel> it's too bad we can't both have our own separate preferences
[07:08] <sobel> just a cryin shame
[07:08] <Zr40> yeah, that's impossible (-:
[07:09] <sobel> that global profile.ini is really obnoxious

[12:51] <depesz> you can't really beat PostgreSQL table with single row and single column, which contained xml, which contained cdata, which contained base64 encoded sqlite db file, which contained couple of tables, and several records.
[12:51] <depesz> to minimize deployment time, code was imported into main app, and the sqlite was distributed to all servers (based on idea that the config doesn't change all that much)
[12:51] <depesz> after some time they figured out that syncing the sqlite file was problematic, so "we need something better".
[12:51] <depesz> "we have shared db". so let's put the thing in postgresql.
[12:52] <depesz> but not data from sqlite. sqlite blob.
[12:52] <depesz> since the whole app was in java, xml was "the sensible choice", and in it you can't have binary blobs, so it was encoded, and stored as cdata in xml.
[12:52] <depesz> application, on each start, would get the xml, extract sqlite blob, write it to file, pass name of the file to the original code, and then it would read config from there.
[12:52] <depesz> not sure who exatly was responsible for which decision in this partiocular case.

[16:34] <sobel> i hacked an email client lib to let me attach body parts from in-memory objects but i broke a bunch of tests and now i gotta figure out how to do it right or fork :(
[16:34] <sobel> stupid thing only knows how to attach files already on disk
[16:36] <mst>   come to the perl side, our libraries already work

21:19:28 <dk> "wanna switch?"
21:19:40 <Zr40> I'd rather backplane
21:21:53 <Berge> Wanna store-and-forward?
21:22:00 <Berge> Wanna… cut through?
21:22:08 <xiaomiao> ECN
21:22:27 <Berge> Wanna implement decent active queue management?
21:25:28 <Zr40> Berge: I wear a NAT.
21:25:52 <Berge> Zr40: Wanna… destination NAT towards me?
21:26:35 <Zr40> Berge: speak BGP to me
21:27:25 <Zr40> Berge: you can see my ASN if I can see yours
21:28:53 <Berge> Zr40: RIP these pickup lines!
21:29:01 <dk> i think "meet-me room" just got a new meaning.
21:31:24 <Zr40> Berge: would you consider multicasting?
21:35:58 <Berge> Zr40: Want to be my neighbour I can discover?
21:38:52 <Zr40> Berge: sorry, DAD says no
21:39:34 <Berge> Zr40: c'man, we can just hang out and be SLAAC
21:41:32 <Zr40> Berge: AAAA!
21:43:00 <Zr40> Berge: wanna... delegate your prefix?
21:44:03 <Berge> Zr40: Let's meet at an Exchange Point
21:46:02 <Zr40> Berge: my TTL can't reach that; how about a nearby Point of Presence?
21:46:59 <xiaomiao> sounds like you should take this to a private link ;)
21:47:04 <Berge> Zr40: I'm ready to exchange some routes!
21:47:24 <Zr40> xiaomiao: don't worry, we're doing this over wireguard
21:47:57 <Zr40> Berge: come peer with me
